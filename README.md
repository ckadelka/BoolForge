# BoolForge

This package is designed to generate and analyze random Boolean functions and networks, with a focus on the concept of canalization.

## Installation

** Latest Stable Release **

*BoolForge* currently has no stable release.

** Latest Development Release **

Install the code directly from the GitHub page:

`pip install git+https://github.com/ckadelka/BoolForge`

Note that *BoolForge* uses [*networkx*](https://networkx.org/). You may additionally need to install the following:

`pip install networkx`

### Extended Functionality

*BoolForge* has a handful of methods that make use of the [*CANA*](https://github.com/CASCI-lab/CANA) package. However, as these methods are not integral to the functionality of this package, *CANA* is not considered a dependency. To access these methods, install *CANA*:

`pip install cana`

### Compatability

*BoolForge* has methods to convert data for use both to and from other commonly used Boolean Network python packages. These packages would need to be installed separately.

Supported packages include:

 1. [CANA](https://github.com/CASCI-lab/CANA)
 2. [pyboolnet](https://github.com/hklarner/pyboolnet)
