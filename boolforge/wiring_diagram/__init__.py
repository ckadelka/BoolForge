"""
Wiring-diagram representation for dynamical systems.

This module defines the :class:`~boolforge.WiringDiagram` class, which encodes
the directed regulatory topology of a dynamical system independently of any
 update functions.

A wiring diagram specifies, for each node, the set of regulating nodes
(predecessors). Nodes with no regulators are source nodes in the wiring diagram.
Whether such nodes act as constants or identity nodes in dynamical systems 
can only be determined after dynamical update functions are assigned.
