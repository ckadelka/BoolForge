    "## 5. Summary of Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving on to more advanced topics, here is a short summary of the\n",
    "fundamental ideas introduced in this tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1 Boolean functions\n",
    "A Boolean function maps a set of binary inputs (0/1) to a single binary output.\n",
    "BoolForge represents Boolean functions internally by their truth table, i.e.,\n",
    "the list of outputs in lexicographic order of the input combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Representations of Boolean functions\n",
    "Boolean functions can be created from:\n",
    "- a truth table (list of 0s and 1s),\n",
    "- a logical expression written in Python syntax,\n",
    "- algebraic combinations of existing BooleanFunction objects using operations such as  \n",
    "  `|` (OR), `*` (AND), `^` (XOR), and other supported Boolean operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each representation produces an equivalent internal truth-table-based object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.3 Variable names and ordering\n",
    "BoolForge automatically infers variable names from the order of first appearance\n",
    "in expressions.  \n",
    "This order determines the indexing of the truth table and therefore affects how\n",
    "the function interacts with larger Boolean networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.4 Basic properties of Boolean functions\n",
    "BoolForge can compute structural properties, including:\n",
    "- the number of variables (`n`),\n",
    "- the Hamming weight (number of 1s in the truth table),\n",
    "- absolute bias (imbalance between 0s and 1s),\n",
    "- essential and non-essential variables,\n",
    "- positive/negative influence of each input.\n",
    "\n",
    "These properties help characterize the function’s behavior and are used\n",
    "throughout later tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.5 Conversions and interoperability\n",
    "BoolForge supports conversion between representations (e.g., truth table <-->\n",
    "polynomial form) and is compatible with external packages such as **CANA** for\n",
    "advanced analysis.  \n",
    "This makes it easy to move between analytical frameworks and combine capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these concepts provide the foundation for understanding canalization,\n",
    "random Boolean function generation, and eventually the construction and analysis\n",
    "of full Boolean networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## 6. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1 Why does the order of variables matter?\n",
    "The order in which variables appear determines the ordering of the truth table.\n",
    "For a function with variables `[A, B, C]`, the entry in position `i` corresponds\n",
    "to the binary representation of `i` over `(A, B, C)`.  \n",
    "If two equivalent expressions list variables in different orders, their truth\n",
    "tables will be indexed differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure reproducibility, always use consistent variable names and ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.2 How do I choose between defining a function via a truth table or via an expression?\n",
    "Use a **truth table** if:\n",
    "- you want full control over the outputs,\n",
    "- you generated the table programmatically,\n",
    "- or a biological dataset already provides the output values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a **textual expression** if:\n",
    "- the function has a natural logical description (e.g., `A and B`),\n",
    "- you want readability,\n",
    "- or you want BoolForge to automatically determine variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both methods produce identical internal representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.3 How do I control the variable names for a truth-table-defined function?\n",
    "By default, BoolForge assigns names `x0, x1, ...`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want custom variable names, specify them explicitly:"

    "### 6.5 What is the difference between get_type_of_inputs() and monotonicity?\n",
    "The method .get_type_of_inputs() identifies whether each input variable influences the\n",
    "function positively, negatively, or not at all.\n",
    "Monotonicity is a global property describing whether all inputs influence the\n",
    "output in a consistent direction.\n",
    "A function with at least one conditional input is thus non-monotone, even though some\n",
    " inputs may have clear influence types (either positive or negative).\n",
    " \n",
    "### 6.6 Why do some functions have essential and non-essential variables?\n",
    "A variable is *essential* if changing its value can change the output.\n",
    "A variable is *non-essential* if the output never depends on it.\n",
    "Example: `f(A,B) = A`. Here, B is non-essential and can be removed without changing the function.\n",
    "When later creating Boolean networks, Boolean functions are simplified to remove any non-essential inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.7 What should I do if BoolForge raises an error when creating a function?\n",
    "Most errors occur due to:\n",
    "    \n",
    "- incorrect truth-table length,\n",
    "- non-binary entries,\n",
    "- or syntax errors in expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check the “Common Errors” section above for guidance.\n",
    "If the issue persists, verify that your Python expression is valid and that\n",
    "variable names are consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.8 Why does BoolForge use Python boolean expressions instead of custom syntax?\n",
    "This design choice:\n",
    "    \n",
    "- avoids learning a new grammar,\n",
    "- leverages Python’s native evaluation,\n",
    "- ensures compatibility with symbolic tools,\n",
    "- and allows extremely flexible function definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as the expression evaluates to 0/1 for all input combinations, it is valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.9 Are Boolean functions in BoolForge intended only for biology?\n",
    "No. Although BoolForge includes tools specifically inspired by gene regulatory\n",
    "networks, Boolean functions appear across:\n",
    "    \n",
    "- biology & medicine (e.g., signaling pathways)\n",
    "- engineering & computer science (e.g., digital logic design, circuit simplification, control theory),\n",
    "- mathematics & theoretical modeling.\n",
