    "## 1. Boolean network theory\n",
    "\n",
    "A *Boolean network* $F=(f_1,\\ldots,f_N)$ constitutes a popular modeling framework in systems biology.\n",
    "It consists of $N$ nodes (e.g., genes, proteins, etc.).\n",
    "Each node can only be in two states, 0 or 1.\n",
    "With biology in mind, these two states are often referred to as absence or OFF (e.g., low protein concentration) and presence or ON (e.g., high protein concentration), respectively.\n",
    "Each node $x_i$ in a Boolean network possesses a Boolean *update function* $f_i: \\{0,1\\}^N \\to \\{0,1\\}$ (i.e., an instance of `BooleanFunction`),\n",
    "which describes the state of $x_i$ at the next time point given the current state of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under a synchronous updating scheme, all nodes are updated simultaneously.\n",
    "In this case, $F: \\{0,1\\}^N \\to \\{0,1\\}^N$ defines a deterministic state transition graph,\n",
    "which consists of the $2^N$ states $\\mathbf x=(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\in \\{0,1\\}^N$ and their deterministically defined transitions. This deterministic map fully characterizes the system’s dynamics under synchronous updating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous updating schemes allow for nodes to be updated separately, at potentially different time scales (Thomas & d'Ari, Biological feedback, 1990).\n",
    "In most schemes, only a single node is updated at a time.\n",
    "In this case, the state space is typically stochastic because $\\mathbf x\\in \\{0,1\\}^N$ may transition to $N$ different states $\\mathbf  y\\in \\{0,1\\}^N$,\n",
    "depending on which node $x_i$ is updated.\n",
    "`BoolForge` implements both a synchronous updating scheme and a general asynchronous updating scheme\n",
    "(each node is updated with equal probability (Harvey & Bossomaier, Proc 4th Eur. Conf. on Artificial Life, 1997),\n",
    "which has been established as the most efficient and informative asynchronous updating method (Saadatpour et al., Journal of Theoretical Biology, 2010).\n",
    "\n",
    "While each update function $f_i$ may, in theory, depend on all $N$ inputs, real Boolean networks (e.g., gene regulatory network models) are frequently sparsely connected,\n",
    "i.e., each node is only regulated by one or a few nodes.\n",
    "The *in-degree* of node $x_i$ is defined as the number of essential variables of update function $f_i$.\n",
    "The *wiring diagram* (also known as *dependency graph*, *interaction matrix*, or *adjacency matrix*) of a Boolean network contains the $N$ nodes $x_1,\\ldots,x_N$,\n",
    "and an edge from $x_i$ to $x_j$ if the update of $x_j$ depends on $x_i$, i.e., if $x_i$ is an essential variable of $f_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## 2. Wiring diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we will learn how to create instances of the class `WiringDiagram`, which the class `BooleanNetwork` is built upon.\n",
    "To create a wiring diagram of $N$ nodes, it suffices to describe \"who regulates who\".\n",
    "That is, we must provide a list of N lists describing the indices of the regulators.\n",
    "If the ith list has length n, that means the ith variable is regulated by n variables.\n",
    "As an example, we define a wiring diagram on $N=3$ nodes."
